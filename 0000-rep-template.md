# Title - replace me with feature name

## Summary

Provide a brief paragraph explaining the feature.

## Motivation

Outline the reasons behind implementing this feature, the use cases it supports, and the expected outcomes.

## Detailed design

The core of the REP. Elaborate on the design and implementation with sufficient detail for someone familiar with Bicep to grasp. Provide detailed examples to illustrate how the feature is used and its implications on user experience.

### Examples

- Example 1
```bicep
```
- Example 2
```bicep
```

## Drawbacks

Discuss any potential drawbacks associated with this approach. Why might this *not* be a suitable choice? Consider implementation costs, integration with existing and planned features, and the migration cost for Bicep users. Clearly identify if it constitutes a breaking change.

## Alternatives
Explore alternative designs that were considered and clarify why the chosen design stands out among possible options. Provide rationale and discuss the impact of not selecting other designs.

## Unresolved questions
- What aspects of the design do you expect to resolve through the REP process before merging?
- What parts of the design do you anticipate resolving through feature implementation before stabilization?
- What related issues are considered out of scope for this REP but could be addressed independently in the future?
