# [Breaking Change (delete if not applicable)] Title - replace me with feature name

## Summary

> Provide a brief paragraph explaining the feature.

## Terms and definitions

> Include any terms, definitions, or acronyms that are used in this design document to assist the reader.

## Motivation

> Outline the reasons behind implementing this feature, the use cases it supports, and the expected outcomes.

## Detailed design

> The core of the REP. Elaborate on the design and implementation with sufficient detail for someone familiar with Bicep to grasp. Provide detailed examples to illustrate how the feature is used and its implications on user experience.

### Client side changes

### Server side changes (if applicable)

### Microsoft.Resources/deployments API changes (if applicable)

### Examples

- Example 1
```bicep
```
- Example 2
```bicep
```

## Drawbacks

> Discuss any potential drawbacks associated with this approach. Why might this *not* be a suitable choice? Consider implementation costs, integration with existing and planned features, and the migration cost for Bicep users. Clearly identify if it constitutes a breaking change.

## Alternatives

> Explore alternative designs that were considered and clarify why the chosen design stands out among possible options. Provide rationale and discuss the impact of not selecting other designs.

## Rollout plan

> Describe how you will deliver your feature. Does it need to be an experimental feature? If the feature involves backend changes, dose it need to be guarded by an ARM feature flag?

## Unresolved questions

> - What aspects of the design do you expect to resolve through the REP process before merging?
> - What parts of the design do you anticipate resolving through feature implementation before stabilization?

## Out of scope

> - What related issues are considered out of scope for this REP but could be addressed independently in the future?
